<p>John-ny Wil-son and Ned Brown were play-ing at ball one day, and the
ball hit John on the hand: he was ve-ry an-gry, and ran af-ter Ned and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>beat him ve-ry hard. Just then, a man came by and gave John a box on
the ear which made him let go of Ned, and he be-gan to cry. Then the man
said, &ldquo;You beat that lit-tle boy and for-get how you hurt him, but you
do not like it your-self."</p>

<p>Then John was sor-ry, and said he would ne-ver do so any more; he shook
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>hands with Ned, and he kept his word, and all who knew him lov-ed him.</p>

<p>Jane North was an i-dle girl; she did not like her book, and when she
was told to read her les-son she would cry, and say she want-ed to play
with her doll. So her doll was tak-en from her till she had read; but
she read ill, and would not learn to write. So she grew up a dunce, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>no one lov-ed her.</p>

<p>Had each a nice doll, and they took care of them. One day Tom call-ed
them to play at ball, and they ran a-way to play, and left the two dolls
on a chair. By and by the cat came in the room, and pull-ed the dolls to
pieces, think-ing I dare say, that it was fine fun to tear them to bits,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>and scam-per round the room with poor dol-ly's nose in her mouth.</p>

<p>When the girls came back, and saw the nice new dolls all in bits, they
be-gan to cry, and to beat poor puss; but their mam-ma said, &ldquo;No, you
must not beat puss, for you left your dolls a-bout, and the cat did not
know that they were not for her to play with. Next time you must be more

<p>Was a kind girl. One day she was out, and a poor girl came to her and
said, &ldquo;Give me some bread, I have had none to eat all day.&rdquo; So Ann said,
&ldquo;I have no bread, but here is six-pence that my mam-ma gave me, take it,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>and buy some bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor girl took it and said, &ldquo;Oh! thank you, miss, I can now get
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>some-thing to eat, and will take some to my poor dad-dy who is sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not go out with-out your warm coat, Tom; it is a hard frost, and the
snow lies thick on the ground, and you will catch cold, if you do, and
then poor Tom will be ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I feel quite warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do now; but see what a large fire there is here, out of doors
there is no fire, and the cold wind blows; and if you have no warm coat
on, you will feel cold.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>But Tom thought he knew best, so he went out with no coat on, and he
caught a bad cold and cough, and he was put to bed quite ill. Now Jack
and Will and Tom were to have had some fine sport on the fro-zen pond in
the farm, but Tom was too ill to go. When he was in bed he thought how
sil-ly he had been, to think he knew bet-ter than his kind friends; and
then he said to him-self, he would try and do all that he was bid when
he got well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>One day a child want-ed to reach some-thing off the man-tel shelf, and
not be-ing tall e-nough, she stood on the fen-der, and her mo-ther said,
&ldquo;Fan-ny, you must not get on the fen-der, it will turn o-ver, and then
you will fall in the fire and be sad-ly burnt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Fan-ny was not a good child, and did not al-ways do as she was bid:
so when her mo-ther went out of the room, she want-ed to get her
fa-ther's watch that lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> on the man-tel shelf, and she stood on the
fen-der to reach it, but the fen-der turn-ed o-ver, and Fan-ny fell in
the hearth and her clothes took fire. She scream-ed loud-ly, but she was
not heard for a lit-tle time, and when her mo-ther ran to her, all her
clothes were in a blaze; she roll-ed the rug over to put out the flame
and then car-ried her to bed.</p>

<p>Poor Fan-ny was sad-ly burnt, and it was a long time be-fore she was
well, and she had a great many scars on her face and neck which ne-ver
wore off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack did not love his book; he was i-dle, and was cross when he was sent
to school, and one day when he ought to have gone, he play-ed a-bout the
mea-dows in-stead; and he met Sam, who was go-ing to school, and he
said, &ldquo;Come and play with me, Sam, and we will have some fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I must go and learn to read, or I shall be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> dunce; so
come with me, Jack, and then af-ter school is o-ver we will play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is so hard to learn,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and I want to climb that tree
to get a bird's nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, do not get a bird's nest, for it is cru-el,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Come with
me and try to earn the prize, come, Jack-y, to please me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack then went to school, and he found that when he tried to learn, it
was not very hard, and he could soon read pret-ty sto-ries, and won a
nice prize.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

your-self. That is right, you will soon learn to do it fast.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, it
is not hard to learn: now let us go and have a race. One, two, three,
and off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, you have won it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I run bet-ter than you; and you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> play
trap-bat-and-ball bet-ter than I do.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I am too hot to run any more,

should you like one too?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, but I have no wood to make one.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well,
we will ask Dick to give you some wood; come now and ask him.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, dear Ann, sit down and sew a lit-tle.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, mam-ma, shall I hem
my frock?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ann was a good child, and al-ways did as she was bid, and when she had
done her work her mam-ma told her to play with her brother. Ann had a
lit-tle gar-den of her own, and she had made an ar-bour in it. When she
went to play she found her bro-ther cry-ing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> for he had fall-en down,
and broken her ar-bour to pieces. But Ann said, &ldquo;You must not cry, dear,
ne-ver mind break-ing the ar-bour, we will soon build it up.&rdquo; So she
kiss-ed him, and they work-ed till tea time and made a bet-ter ar-bour
than be-fore. And Ann felt much more hap-py than she would have been had
she scold-ed and been cross with poor lit-tle George.</p>
